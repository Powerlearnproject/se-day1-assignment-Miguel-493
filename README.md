#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is apply engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Software engineering is important in the technology industry by enabling the creation of softwar applications and system that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering iclude the development of programming languages, secondly the establishment of software engineering as a discipline and thirdly the advent of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
SDLC Phases:
Requirements: This is the gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements.
Design: The creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architectureand user interface.
Implementation: This is where writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: This is where various test are conducted to endure that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: This where the software is released to customers.
Maintenance: Tis where ongoing support is provideded, updates and enhancementsto the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The WaterFall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases where one phases must be completed before moving on to the next. While the Agile methodology is an iterative incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change, which means that phases are not completed in a sequential pattern instead it is completed based on the need at that particular time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
As a Software Developer it is their role and responsibility to write code and implement software solutions.
As a Quality Assurance Engineer it is their role and responsibility to ensure quality by desining and executing test plans.
As a Project Manager it is their role and responsibility to oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are impotant in software development because they provide comprehensive tools fro writing, debugging and testing code. An example of this is Visual Studio.
VCS are impotant in software development because they use various tools to track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. An example of this is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challenges faced by software engineers are Changing requirements and tight deadlines. To overcome these challenges we can use various methods such as breaking down the project into smaller more manageable iterations and completing each iterations and recieving feedback from stakeholders, another method would be allocating specific time frames for each phase of the project by doing this the team will be able to work on a specific phases within alloted time frame.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is a type of testing that test all individual components of the software, it is important to ensure that all components are working effectively. Integration testing is the testing of interactions between between different components or subsystems, integration testing is important because it aids in how interactions between different components work. System test include testing the entire software system as a whole, this is important to see if the entire software works as how it was intended. Acceptance Testing is the testing of the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs it is important because it allows the developer to see if software meets requirements of the user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Interacting with a AI model is important because it aids in decision making as well as continuous learning and improvement.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
Give examples of programing langauges.
Concise Prompt:
Give three examples of programming langauges used in software development.
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides specific instructions for the AI therefore it provides a more specific response.
